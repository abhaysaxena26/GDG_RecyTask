Hi
For this project, I used various CSS features such as flexbox for layout, media queries to make the design responsive, and CSS animations to add effects like fading and scaling for interactive elements. I also implemented a countdown timer using JavaScript, where the remaining time until the new year is displayed dynamically. Despite my efforts to make the page responsive using media queries, it doesnâ€™t work as expected on all devices, but I did my best to ensure it adapts to different screen sizes. Thank you!
